Developed by ThinkDrop Consulting [thinkdrop.net]


This module allows you to handle Node Teaser layouts using Panels.

Once enabled, visit Administer > Site Building > Teaser Panels
[admin/build/teasers] to configure.

To create different layouts for different content types, add a variant and
add "Selection Rules" to determine whether or not to use that layout.
